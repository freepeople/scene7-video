## <a name="linkingVideo">Linking a video URL to a mobile site or a website</a>

After you publish a video, you can obtain its URL for use in your website, mobile site, or desktop application. Use the video URL when you
want to display video in a pop-up or modal window on top of the web page.

When a customer clicks the link, their device, bandwidth, and screen size are automatically detected. The appropriate video is displayed for
playback in a pre-defined viewer for desktop, or in the mobile device's native video player for smartphones and tablets.

### Implementing embed code for using HTML5 video with MP4 and OGG video assets

If you do not use the Scene7 HTML5 video player, but instead want to use the native HTML5 <video> tag with MP4 and OGG video assets, you can use the following embed code sample:
````
    <video poster="S7 video thumbnail URL" controls>
        <source src="S7 OGG video asset URL (no player)" type='video/ogg; codecs="theora, vorbis"'/>
        <source src="S7 MP4 mobile progressive video asset URL (no player)" type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.4D401E, mp4a.40.2"'/>
        <p>This is fallback content</p>
    </video>
````

* Replace **"S7 video thumbnail URL"** with the video's thumbnail URL. You can obtain video thumbnail URLs in **Detail View** in the **URLs and Embed Code** panel. Click **Copy URL** to the right of the video thumbnail to copy its URL.

* Replace **"S7 OGG video asset URL (no player)"** with the video's progressive URL for OGG video. See [Linking](#linkingVideo) a video URL to a mobile site or a website.

* Replace **"S7 MP4 mobile progressive video asset URL (no player)"** with the video's mobile progressive URL. See [Linking](#linkingVideo) a video URL to a mobile site or a website.
